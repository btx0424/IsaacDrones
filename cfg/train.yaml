# Instructions:
# Setting either "headless=false" or "offscreen_render=true" would make Isaac Sim
# load rendering-related extensions upon startup, which consumes about 1-2G GPU
# memory. The difference is, "headless=false" will opens up a GUI and is suited
# for local debugging, and "offscreen_render=true" is suited for recording
# videos during training.

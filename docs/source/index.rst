Welcome to OmniDrones's documentation!
======================================

**OmniDrones** is an open-source platform designed for reinforcement learning research on multi-rotor drone systems. 
Built on `Nvidia Isaac Sim <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/overview.html>`__, 
**OmniDrones** features highly efficient and flxeible simulation that can be adopted for various research purposes.

.. note::

   2023-9-25: The initial release of **OmniDrones** is developed based on Isaac Sim 2022.2.0. As the next version of 
   Isaac Sim (2023.1.0) is expected to bring susbtantial changes but is not yet available, the APIs and usage 
   of **OmniDrones** are subject to change. We will try our best to keep the documentation up-to-date.


The platform, as released with `our paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12825>`__, currently focus on end-to-end 
learning of agile controllers for drones. It offers a suite of benchmark tasks and algorithm baselines to provide 
preliminary results for subsequent works. 

An overview of the platform is shown below:
